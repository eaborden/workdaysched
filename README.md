### PROJECT GOAL

Create a calendar that includes a typical workday with the hours nine o'clock to five o'clock.  The schedule will show each hour as a row.  The rows will be color coded to show which hours have past (grey), currrent hour (red), and future hour (green).  The application will have a save button for each hour block.  This will allow the user to close the application, and when it is re-opened the appointment will still be on the calendar.
